Unfortunately, not every project, tool, or resource can be considered for inclusion. The aim of Awesome BigBlueButton is to be a concise list of noteworthy and interesting resources available for BigBlueButton. Therefore, suggested software should:

1. Be widely recommended, preferably featured or discussed in recognized BigBlueButton forums, blogs, or events.
2. Well-known or discussed within the BigBlueButton community.
3. Be unique in its approach or function.
4. Fill a niche gap in the market.

Self-promotion is frowned upon, so please consider seriously whether your project meets these criteria before opening a pull request. Otherwise, it may be closed without being reviewed.

Also, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Ensure the BigBlueButton resource is actively maintained (updated within the past six months) and well documented in English.
- Search previous suggestions to avoid duplication. If you find a similar resource, consider contributing to the existing entry.
- Provide a meaningful pull request description.
- Include a link to each resource in your pull request ticket for easier review.
- Make an individual commit for each suggestion in a separate pull request.
- Use the following format for resources: `[Resource Name](LINK) - Description.` Example: `[BigBlueButton Extension](https://example.com) - A tool for enhancing webinar interaction.`
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categories, are always welcome.
- Keep descriptions short, simple, and unbiased. Avoid buzzwords or marketing jargon.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
